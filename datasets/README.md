### dataset updates

February 2024: 

* the first year of data is up! 
* note: one of the feeds disconnected over the course of the year leading to an incomplete dataset for the keyword “gender identity” set to UK regional settings in the primary dataset.
* The data before and after the outage remains in the dataset, but _anyone doing regional analysis should exclude that keyword/region combination_.
* The feed is back up and running, and every half year or so I’ll upload a new dataset.
* I have also included a set of keywords that were presumed (correctly it would seem) to lead to inflamatory news results. This comprises around 8 months of data and is also available.
* new dataviz is up in plots, now compatible with ggdark

Some _very_ preliminary analysis is available here [jessk.org/blog](https://jessk.org/blog/anatomy-of-a-moral-panic), more coming soon...
